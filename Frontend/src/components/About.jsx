          Hello! I’m <strong>Ashutosh Shukla</strong>, a passionate tech enthusiast and the creator of <strong>Reactify</strong> and <strong>Aprameya Productions</strong>.
          I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) at CMR Institute of Technology (CMRIT).

          accessible to everyone.

          As a CSE student, I have gained a solid foundation in software development, algorithms, and data structures. My education has
          equipped me with the skills to solve real-world problems through technology. I actively seek opportunities to apply my knowledge
          through projects and internships, further honing my practical skills.

          Apart from coding, I’m one of the founding members of <strong>Aprameya Productions</strong>, where we bring creative storytelling to life.
          I enjoy blending technical and creative aspects in various projects, which helps me grow as a versatile developer and creator.
